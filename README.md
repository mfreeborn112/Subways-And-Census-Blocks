# NYC Subway Stops and Population Analysis

This repository contains datasets and scripts to visualize the proximity of New York City's population to subway stops. The goal is to estimate how many people live within a 10-minute walk or a 10-minute bike ride of a subway station.

## Prerequisites

- Upload the necessary files from this repository into Google Colab.
- Ensure you have the required Python packages:

## Usage
 - Run the scripts to process the datasets.
 - Load the processed .geojson files into Tableau.
 - In Tableau, perform a join calculation on the geospatial field "Geometry" to analyze both population and subway lines on a single map.

## Objective

By analyzing and visualizing the datasets in Tableau, we hope to provide insights into:
-  The percentage of the population living near subway stops.
-  Estimates on the number of people within a 10-minute walk or bike ride from a subway station.
